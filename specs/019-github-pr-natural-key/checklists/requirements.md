# Specification Quality Checklist: GitHub Pull Request Natural Key

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-08-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation iteration 1 (2026-08-10): All checklist items passed.
- Spec deliberately avoids naming persistence engines, frameworks, or endpoint paths; retrieve/import behavior is described in product terms and tied to the existing GitHub PR import capability by feature purpose.
- Assumed “pull request id” = GitHub pull request identifier paired with repository id; documented under Assumptions.
